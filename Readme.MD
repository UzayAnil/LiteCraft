#### LiteCraft
A lightweight, singleplayer only Minecraft clone <br />

### Goals:
 - Learn the (old) Minecraft codebase inside and out
 - Practice Java and learn new techniques
 - Create a clone of Minecraft with as little original code and as many open-source 
   libraries as possible

### Planned Changes from Vanilla Minecraft
 - No more multiplayer. (It adds a lot of lines of code, as well as requiring an entirely 
   different app for a server.)
 - No more "End" (It's a uniquely Minecraft thing, we need to distance ourselves from 
   the IP a bit)
 - Pretty much any creature, monster, item, block, dimension that's unique to Minecraft will not 
   be present either.
