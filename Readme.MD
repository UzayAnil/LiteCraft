# LiteCraft
A lightweight, singleplayer only Minecraft clone

#### Goals:
 - Learn the (old) Minecraft codebase inside and out
 - Practice Java and learn new techniques
 - Create a clone of Minecraft with as little original code and as many open-source 
   libraries as possible
 - Use a mainly data-driven structure, allowing for easier additions (and removals) of features, saving custom classes for only really unique features. (So all farmable mobs would share the same class, for instance.)
 
#### Planned Feature Changes from Vanilla Minecraft
 - No more multiplayer. (It adds a lot of lines of code, as well as requiring an entirely 
   different app for a server.)
 - No more "End" (It's a uniquely Minecraft thing, we need to distance ourselves from 
   the IP a bit)
 - Pretty much any creature, monster, item, block, dimension that's unique to Minecraft will not 
   be present either.
 - These features will be replaced by our own original ideas, or some more generic ones, instead.
 - Only built-in texture packs. This allows us to write fewer lines of code to process custom resources
